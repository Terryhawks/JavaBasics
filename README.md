# JavaBasics
Java Basics, made following Kaupenjoe's Tutorial on Java for Minecraft Modding.

I plan on making Mods sometime in the Future, but i'm learning the very basics through making this.
It's all based on Kaupenjoe's Tutorial, but all in one Repo, instead of the Main.java resetting each time.
